# Longest Palindromic Substring
## Description:
### Given a string consisting of lower case English letters, the program finds the longest palindromic substring of length atleast two, in the string using Dynamic Programming paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line and the only line should contain the string consisting of lower case English letters only
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of a single string denoting the longest palindromic substring of length atleast two in the string
* If no such palindrome exists, the first line will contain "None"
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n^2)
