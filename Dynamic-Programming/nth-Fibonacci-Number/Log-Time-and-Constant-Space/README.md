# nth Fibonacci Number in Log Time and Constant Space
## Description:
### Given a non-negative integer n, the program computes the nth Fibonacci Number using Dynamic Programming paradigm in Logarithmic Time and Constant Space Complexity
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the non-negative integer n
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the nth Fibonacci Number
## Time Complexity:
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
