# nth Fibonacci Number in Linear Time and Space
## Description:
### Given a non-negative integer n, the program computes the nth Fibonacci Number using Dynamic Programming paradigm in Linear Time and Space Complexity.
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the non-negative integer n. 
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the nth Fibonacci Number.
## Time Complexity:
* O(n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n)
