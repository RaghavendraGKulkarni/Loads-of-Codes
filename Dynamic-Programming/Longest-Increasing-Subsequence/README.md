# Longest Increasing Subsequence
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements, the program computes the longest increasing subsequence using Dynamic Programming paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain the positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the longest increasing subsequence of the array
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n)
