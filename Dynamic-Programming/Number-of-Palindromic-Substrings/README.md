# Number of Palindromic Substrings
## Description:
### Given a string consisting of lower case English letters, the program counts the total number of palindromic substrings of length atleast two, in the string using Dynamic Programming paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line and the only line should contain the string consisting of lower case English letters only
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of a single integer denoting the number of palindromic substrings of length atleast two in the string
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n^2)
