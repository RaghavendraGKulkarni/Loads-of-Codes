# Square Submatrices with all 1s
## Description:
### Given an mxn binary grid, the program counts the number of square matrices with all ones in it using Dynamic Programming paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two space separated integers denoting m and n
* The next m lines each should contain n space separated integers (0 or 1) denoting the row
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the number of square matrices with all ones in it
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n^2)
