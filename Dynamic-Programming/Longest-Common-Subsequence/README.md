# Longest Common Subsequence
## Description:
### Given two integer arrays of m and n elements, the program computes the longest common subsequence using Dynamic Programming paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two space separated integers denoting m and n
* The second line should contain m space separated integers denoting the first array
* The third line should contain n space separated integers denoting the second array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the longest common subsequence
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n^2)
