# Fractional Knapsack
## Description:
### Given an array of n items with certain weight and value and a knapsack of maximum capacity w, the program finds the maximum profit attainable by collecting the items into the knapsack where taking fraction of an item is allowed
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n and an integer w denoting the number of items and knapsack capacity, respectively
* The next n lines should contain two integers w and v denoting the weight and value of an item
## Output Format:
* The first line will contain an integer k denoting the number of items included in the knapsack and a real number denoting the maximum attainable profit
* The next k lines each will contain an item included in the knapsack denoted by three space separated numbers, weight, value and the fraction of the item included
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
