# Jump Game
## Description:
### Given an array of n non-negative integers where each integer denotes the maximum length jump possible from that position, the program finds the minimum number of jumps required to reach position n starting from position 1
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The next line should contain n space separated non-negative integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and only line will contain the minimum number of jumps required to reach position n starting from position 1
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
