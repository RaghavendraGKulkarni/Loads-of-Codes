# Run Length Encoding
## Description:
### Given a non-negative integer n (atmost 100 digits) in the form of a string, the program finds the Run Length Encoding of the number n
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the non-negative integer n
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the Run Length Encoding of n
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
