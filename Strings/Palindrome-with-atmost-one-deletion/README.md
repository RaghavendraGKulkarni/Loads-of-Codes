## Description:
### Given a string of lower case English letters, the program checks whether the string can be made palindrome by atmost one character deletion
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the string to be checked
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain "Yes" if the string can be made palindrome by atmost one character deletion and "No" otherwise
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
