# Binary Search
## Description:
### Given a sorted non decreasing array of n elements, the program finds the first and last occurrence of a given element (1 - indexed) using the Divide and Conquer paradigm.
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers n and k denoting the size of the array and the element to be found.
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array.
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain two space separated integers denoting the first and last occurrence.
* If the element is not found, -1 is printed only once.
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
