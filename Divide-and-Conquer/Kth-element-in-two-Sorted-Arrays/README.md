# Kth element in two Sorted Arrays
## Description:
### Given two non-decreasing sorted arrays of m and n elements respectively, the program finds the kth element (1-indexed) of the sorted array after merging the two arrays, using the Divide and Conquer (Binary Search) paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain three positive integers m, n and k denoting the sizes of the first and second arrays and the index of the element required respectively
* The second line should contain m space separated integers denoting the first array
* The third line should contain n space separated integers denoting the second array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain an integer value denoting the kth element (1-indexed) of the combined sorted array
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log min(m, n))
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
