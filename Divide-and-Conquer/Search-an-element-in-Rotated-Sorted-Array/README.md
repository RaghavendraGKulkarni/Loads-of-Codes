# Search an element in a Rotated Sorted Array
## Description:
### Given a sorted and possibly rotated (either left or right) array of n elements, the program finds the index of a given element (1 - indexed) using the Divide and Conquer (Binary Search) paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n and an integer k denoting the size of the array and the element to be found respectively
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain one integer denoting the index of the element
* If the element is not found, -1 is printed
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
