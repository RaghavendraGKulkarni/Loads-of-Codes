# Single element in a Sorted Array
## Description:
### Given a sorted non decreasing array of n elements where all but one element occur twice and one element occurs once, the program finds the single occuring element using Divide and Conquer (Binary Search) paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain element occuring only once in the array
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
