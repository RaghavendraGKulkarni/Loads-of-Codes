# First and Last Occurrence in a Sorted Array
## Description:
### Given a sorted non decreasing array of n elements, the program finds the first and last occurrence of a given element (1 - indexed) using the Divide and Conquer paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n and an integer k denoting the size of the array and the element to be found respectively
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain two space separated integers denoting the first and last occurrence
* If the element is not found, -1 is printed only once
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
