# Inversions in an Array
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements, the program counts the number of inversions in the array using Divide and Conquer paradigm.
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array to be sorted.
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array to be sorted.
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of a single integer denoting the number of inversions in the array.
## Time Complexity:
* O(n log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n)
