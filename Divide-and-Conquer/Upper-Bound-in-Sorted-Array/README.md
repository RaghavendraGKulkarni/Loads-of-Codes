# Upper Bound in a Sorted Array
## Description:
### Given a sorted non decreasing array of n elements, the program finds the index(1 - indexed) of the smallest element greater than a given number using the Divide and Conquer paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n and an integer k denoting the size of the array and the number respectively
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the sorted array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the index of the smallest element greater than a given number
* If no such element exists, -1 is printed
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
