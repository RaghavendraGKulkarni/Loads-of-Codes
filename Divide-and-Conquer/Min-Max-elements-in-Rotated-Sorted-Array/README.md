# Min-Max elements in a Rotated Sorted Array
## Description:
### Given a sorted and possibly rotated (either left or right) array of n distinct elements, the program finds the minimum and maximum elements in the array using the Divide and Conquer (Binary Search) paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain two space separated integers denoting the minimum and maximum elements respectively
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
