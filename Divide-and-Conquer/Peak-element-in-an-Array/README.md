# Peak element in an Array
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements, the program finds a peak element, which is greater than its immediate neighbors using the Divide and Conquer (Binary Search) paradigm. Here, we assume that the first element is greater than its left neighbor and last element is greater than its right neighbor
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain one integer denoting the peak element
## Time Complexity: 
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
