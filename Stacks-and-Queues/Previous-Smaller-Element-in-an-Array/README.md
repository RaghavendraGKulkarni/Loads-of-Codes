# Previous Smaller Element in an Array
## Description:
### Given an array of n elements, the program finds the immediate previous smaller element to every every element in the array using Stacks.
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integers n denoting the size of the array.
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array.
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain n space separated integers denoting the immediate previous smaller element to every every element in the array.
* If there is no previous smaller element, -1 is printed for that element.
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
