# Next Greater Element in an Array
## Description:
### Given an array of n elements, the program finds the immediate next greater element to every element in the array using Stacks
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain n space separated integers denoting the immediate next greater element to every element in the array
* If there is no next greater element, -1 is printed for that element
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
