# Largest Rectangle in a Histogram
## Description:
### Given an array of n elements representing the heights of n bars in a Histogram, the program finds the largest rectangle that can be formed by the bars using Stacks
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first line will contain the area of the largest rectangle formed
* The second line will contain two space separated integers denoting the indices (1-indexed) of the leftmost and rightmost bars of the rectangle
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
