# Area of Largest Submatrix with 1s
## Description:
### Given a m x n binary matrix, the program finds the largest rectangle containing only 1s using Stacks
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers m and n denoting the size of the matrix
* The next m lines each should contain n space separated integers (0 or 1) denoting the row of the matrix
## Output Format:
* The first line will contain the area of the largest rectangle formed
* The second line will contain four integers denoting the top, bottom, left and right indices of the rectangle (1-indexed)
## Time Complexity: 
* O(m*n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
