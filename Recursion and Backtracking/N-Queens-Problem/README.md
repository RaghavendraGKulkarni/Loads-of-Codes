# N-Queens Problem
## Description:
### Given a positive integer n, the programs lists all possible arrangements of n Queens on a nxn chess board that no two queens can attack each other, using Backtracking paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain a positive integers n (not greater than 10) denoting the value of n
## Output Format:
* The first line contains a descriptive statement about the number of valid configurations followed by an empty line
* Each configuration is a nxn grid with empty cells represented as '*' and Queen occupied cells represented as 'Q'
* Each row of a configuration occupies one line and two adjacent cells in a row are separated by space
* Two configurations are separated by a blank line
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n!)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n!)
