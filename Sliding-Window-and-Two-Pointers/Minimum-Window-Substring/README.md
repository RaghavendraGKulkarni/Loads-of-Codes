# Minimum Window Substring
## Description:
### Given two strings s and t of upper case and lower case English letters, the program finds the smallest substring of s that contains all the characters of t (including duplicates and case sensitive)
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the two strings s and t
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the first smallest substring of s that contains all the characters of t
* If no such minimum substring exists, -1 will be printed
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
