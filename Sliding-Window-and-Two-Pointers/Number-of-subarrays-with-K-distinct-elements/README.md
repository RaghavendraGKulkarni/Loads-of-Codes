# Number of subarrays with k distinct elements
## Description:
### Given an array of n integers, the program finds the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements in it
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers n and k denoting the size of the array and value of k respectively
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denotint the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the number of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
