# Get Set Clear kth bit in a number
## Description:
### Given a 32-bit integer n, the program performs Get, Set or Clear operation on kth bit (1-indexed) from right in the binary representation of the number
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a 32-bit integer n
* The second line should contain a positive integer k (not greater than 32) and the operation name "GET", "SET" or "CLR" separated by space
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the output of the operation
## Time Complexity:
* O(1)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
