# Polynomial Multiplication
## Description:
### Given two non-negative integers m and n and two polynomials of degrees m and n respectively, the program computes the product of the two polynomials using normal multiplication
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two non-negative integers m and n denoting the degrees of the polynomials
* The second line should contain m + 1 space separated integers denoting the constant and co-efficients of the first polynomial in increasing integral powers of the variable
* The third line should contain n + 1 space separated integers denoting the constant and co-efficients of the second polynomial in increasing integral powers of the variable
* Zero coefficients or constant should also be explicitly given in the input
## Output Format:
* The first line will contain a non-negative integer k denoting the degree of the product polynomial
* The second line will contain k + 1 space separated integers denoting the constant and co-efficients of the second polynomial in increasing integral powers of the variable
## Time Complexity:
* O(mn)
## Space Complexity:
* O(m+n)
