# GCD of two numbers in Log Time
## Description:
### Given two positive integers m and n, the program finds the GCD of m and n using Euler's method iteratively
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain two positive integers m and n
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the GCD of m and n
## Time Complexity:
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
