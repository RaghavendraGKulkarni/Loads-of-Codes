# Compute x power n in Log Time
## Description:
### Given an real number x and an integer n (not both zeros), the program computes x power n in Log time iteratively
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a real number x and an integer n
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the value of x to the power n 
## Time Complexity:
* O(log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
