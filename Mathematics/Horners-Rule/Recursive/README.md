# Horner's Rule
## Description:
### Given a polynomial of one variable with integer coefficients and whole number powers, the program evaluates the polynomial for a given value of the variable x using Horner's Rule recursively
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a non-negative integer denoting the degree of the polynomial and an integer denoting x
* The second line shoud contain n + 1 integers denoting the coefficients of the polynomial in increasing order of the variable powers
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the value of the polynomial
## Time Complexity:
* O(n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(1)
