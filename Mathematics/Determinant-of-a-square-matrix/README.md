# Determinant of a square matrix
## Description:
### Given a positive integer n and a real square matrix of order nxn, the program computes the determinant of the matrix by converting it to row-reduced echleon form
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the matrix
* The next n lines should contain n space separated integers denoting the rows of the matrix
## Output Format:
* The first and the only output line will contain a float denoting the determinant of the matrix
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^3)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n^2)
