# Check Bipartite graph
## Description:
### Given an unweighted undirected graph of n vertices and e edges, the program checks whether the graph is bipartite or not
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers n and e denoting the number of vertices and edges in the graph
* The next e lines each should contain two space separated positive integers denoting the from and to of the edge. The vertices from and to must be in the inclusive range [1, n]
## Output Format:
* The first and the only output line will contain "Yes" if the graph is bipartite and "No" otherwise
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
