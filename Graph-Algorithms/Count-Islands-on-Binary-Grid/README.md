# Count Islands on Binary Grid
## Description:
### Given a rectangular binary grid containing 1s representing land and 0s representing water, the program counts the number of islands in the grid, where two land cells are said to be connected if they share an edge in common 
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers m and n denoting the number of rows and columns in the grid
* The next m lines each should contain n space separated integers (either 0 or 1) denoting a row in the grid
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain an integer denoting the number of islands in the grid
## Time Complexity: 
* O(m*n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(m*n)
