# Lexicographical Sort
## Description:
### Given a positive integer n, the program prints the range [1, n] in lexicographical order, recursively
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array to be sorted
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of n space separated integers denoting the sorted array
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
