# Long Factorials
## Description:
### Given a non-negative integer n, the program computes the factorial of n
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the non-negative integer n (not greater than 1000)
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the factorial of n
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2 log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n log n)
