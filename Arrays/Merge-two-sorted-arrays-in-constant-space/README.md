# Merge two sorted arrays in constant space
## Description:
### Given two sorted arrays of m and n elements, the program merges the two arrays into one sorted array in constant space by placing first m elements in the first array and next n elements in the second array
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers m and n denoting the array sizes
* The second line should contain m space separated integers denoting the first array
* The third line should contain n space separated integers denoting the second array
## Output Format:
* The first line of the output will contain m space separated integers denoting the first m elements of the merged array
* The second line of the output will contain n space separated integers denoting the next n elements of the merged array
## Time Complexity: 
* O(mlogm + nlogn)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
