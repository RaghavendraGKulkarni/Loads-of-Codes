# Repeating number in range array
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n + 1 elements where each element is in the range [1, n] with one number repeating, the program finds the repeating element
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the range
* The second line should contain n + 1 space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the repeating element
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
