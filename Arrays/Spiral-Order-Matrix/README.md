# Spiral Order Matrix
## Description:
### Given a matrix of m rows and n columns, the program prints the matrix elements in clockwise spiral order starting from the first row
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers m and n denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix respectively
* The next m lines each should contain n space separated integers denoting each row of the matrix
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain m*n space separated integers denoting the spiral traversal of the matrix
## Time Complexity:
* O(m*n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
