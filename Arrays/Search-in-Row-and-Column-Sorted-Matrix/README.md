# Search in Row and Column Sorted Matrix
## Description:
### Given a matrix of m rows and n columns with each row and column sorted in non-decreasing order, the program finds the index of a given element (1 - indexed)
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integer m and n denoting the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively and an integer k denoting the element to be found
* The next m lines each should contain n space separated integers denoting one row
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain two space separated integers denoting the index of the element
* If the element is not found, -1 is printed
## Time Complexity: 
* O(m + n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
