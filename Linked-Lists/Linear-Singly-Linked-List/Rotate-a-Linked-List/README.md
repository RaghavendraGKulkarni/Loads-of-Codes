# Rotate a Linked List
## Description:
### Given a linear singly linked list, the program rotates the linked list by k units either left or right
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the linked list, followed by -1 or +1 for rotating left or right respectively and a non-negative integer k denoting number of rotations
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the linked list
## Output Format:
* The first and only line will contain the rotated linked list
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
