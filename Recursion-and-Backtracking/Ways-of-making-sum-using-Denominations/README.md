# Ways of making sum using Denominations
## Description:
### Given an infinite supply of n distinct denominations, the program finds all the ways of making sum k with the denominations using Backtracking paradigm
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers n and k, denoting the number of denominations and the target sum respectively
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the denominations
## Output Format:
All the possible combinations of the denominations, each in a new line
## Time Complexity: 
* O(2^n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(2^n)
