# Count Subarrays with given sum
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements, the program counts the subarrays with given sum in the array.
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers n and k denoting the size of the array and the target sum.
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array.
## Output Format:
* The first and only line will contain an integer denoting the count of subarrays that give the sum.
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n)
