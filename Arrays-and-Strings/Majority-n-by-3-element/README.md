# Majority n/3 element
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements, the program finds the elements occuring more than n/3 times, if they exist
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the two majority element(s) if it/they exist(s) and "None" otherwise
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
