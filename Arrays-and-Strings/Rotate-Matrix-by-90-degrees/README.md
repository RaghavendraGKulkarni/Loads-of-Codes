# Rotate Matrix by 90 degrees
## Description:
### Given a matrix of m rows and n columns, the program rotates the matrix by 90 degrees either clockwise or anti-clockwise
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers m and n denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix respectively.
* The next m lines each should contain n space separated integers denoting each row of the matrix
* The last line should contain 1 for clockwise rotation and -1 for anti-clockwise rotation
## Output Format:
* The n lines each will contain m space separated integers denoting the rows of the matrix after rotation
## Time Complexity: 
* O(m*n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
