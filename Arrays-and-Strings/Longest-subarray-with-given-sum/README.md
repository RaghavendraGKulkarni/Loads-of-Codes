# Longest Subarray with given sum
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements, the program finds the longest subarray with given sum in the array.
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain two positive integers n and k denoting the size of the array and the target sum.
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array.
## Output Format:
* The first and only line will contain the longest subarray that gives the sum.
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(n)
