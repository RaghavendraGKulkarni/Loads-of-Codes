# Long Factorials
## Description:
### Given a non-negative integer n (preferrably upto 1000), compute the factorial of n
## Input Format:
* The first and the only line should contain the non-negative integer n. 
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will consist of the factorial of n.
## Time Complexity:
* O(n^2 log n)
## Space Complexity:
* O(n log n)
