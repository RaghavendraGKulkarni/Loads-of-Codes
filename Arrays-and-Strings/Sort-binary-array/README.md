# Sort Binary Array
## Description:
### Given an unsorted array of n elements containing 0s and 1s, the program sorts the array in linear time and constant space.
## Input Format:
* The first line should contain a positive integer n denoting the size of the array.
* The second line should contain n space separated integers denoting the array.
## Output Format:
* The first and the only line will contain the sorted array
## Time Complexity: 
* O(n)
## Space Complexity: 
* O(1)
